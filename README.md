## Introduction
This repository provides structured **Incident Response Playbooks** for security teams to respond efficiently to cybersecurity threats and incidents. The playbooks align with industry best practices and leverage automation where possible.

## Incident Classification
To ensure a streamlined response, classify incidents based on severity:

| Severity Level | Impact Scope | Example |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| SEV1 - Critical | Affects multiple systems/org-wide | Ransomware outbreak |
| SEV2 - High | Significant impact on operations | Data breach |
| SEV3 - Medium | Limited operational impact | Single endpoint malware infection |
| SEV4 - Low | Minimal impact, easily contained | Phishing attempt |
| SEV5 - Informational | No immediate risk | Suspicious login attempt |

## Roles and Responsibilities
Each incident requires defined roles:

- **Incident Manager:** Oversees the response and ensures coordination.
- **Technical Lead:** Conducts technical investigations and coordinates remediation efforts.
- **Communications Manager:** Handles internal/external updates and regulatory notifications.
- **Threat Intelligence Analyst:** Assesses IOCs and provides threat intelligence insights.
- **Forensic Investigator:** Conducts digital forensics for evidence collection.

## Incident Response Procedures
### Preparation
- Maintain an up-to-date asset inventory.
- Implement logging and monitoring across systems.
- Define access controls and enforce least privilege.
- Conduct regular security awareness training.

### Detection & Analysis
- Monitor security alerts from SIEM (e.g., **Splunk**, **Elastic**).
- Analyze logs for anomalous activity using:
  ```bash
  grep 'unauthorized' /var/log/auth.log
  ```
- Perform memory analysis for malware:
  ```bash
  volatility -f memory.dump --profile=Win7SP1x64 malfind
  ```
- Use threat intelligence platforms (e.g., **VirusTotal**, **MISP**).

### Containment
- Isolate affected endpoints from the network:
  ```bash
  iptables -A INPUT -s <malicious-ip> -j DROP
  ```
- Implement firewall rules to block malicious traffic.
- Suspend compromised user accounts in **Active Directory**.

### Eradication
- Remove malicious artifacts (files, registry entries, processes).
- Apply security patches and update antivirus signatures.
- Validate system integrity post-eradication.
